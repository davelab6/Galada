# Galada

Galada is a Bengali and Latin typeface that started with the famous Latin [Lobster](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lobster) font, and translated that informality and sturdiness into the Bangla (Bengali) script.

It is a display typeface that works well at larger sizes.
The Bangla design was developed as a studio collaboration by Jeremie Hornus, Yoann Minet, and Juan Bruce. 
While remaining traditional in terms of letterform style, for optimal legibility, it shares common characteristics with Lobster: 
Slanted, compact, and heavy stokes, and a cursivity that is achieved by the use of inflexions on the horizontal connecting strokes, similar to what happens along the Latin baseline. 

The Galada project is led by Black Foundry, a type design foundry based in Paris, France.
